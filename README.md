# 🛡️ AI Compliance Risk Monitor
**Real-Time GRC Assistant with Semantic Search, ServiceNow Simulation, and Power BI Analytics**

This project tackles a real-world challenge in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC): monitoring AI-driven risks across hybrid cloud environments. It combines semantic search, risk scoring, and dashboarding to simulate enterprise-grade compliance workflows.

---

## Features

- **Semantic Search**  
  Embedding-based matching for HIPAA/SOC2 questions using SentenceTransformers + FAISS

- **Risk Scoring Engine**  
  Detects high-risk queries (e.g., bias, breach, transfer) and assigns dynamic scores

- **ServiceNow Simulation**  
  Creates mock tickets and retrieves KB articles based on query context

- **Power BI Dashboard**  
  Visualizes real-time compliance events, risk trends, and ticket activity

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Clean separation of UI, logic, and mock APIs for scalability

## Demo Queries

Try these in the chatbot:
- “What is HIPAA?”
- “Report a HIPAA breach”
- “SOC2 controls article”
- “Create a compliance incident”
- “Flag model bias in EU”


## How to Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/compliance-risk-monitor.git
cd compliance-risk-monitor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
