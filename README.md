# 🛡️ AI Compliance Risk Monitor
**Real-Time GRC Assistant with Semantic Search, ServiceNow Simulation, and Power BI Analytics**

This project tackles a real-world challenge in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC): monitoring AI-driven risks across hybrid cloud environments. It combines semantic search, risk scoring, and dashboarding to simulate enterprise-grade compliance workflows.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**  
  Embedding-based matching for HIPAA/SOC2 questions using SentenceTransformers + FAISS

- **Risk Scoring Engine**  
  Detects high-risk queries (e.g., bias, breach, transfer) and assigns dynamic scores

- **ServiceNow Simulation**  
  Creates mock tickets and retrieves KB articles based on query context

- **Power BI Dashboard**  
  Visualizes real-time compliance events, risk trends, and ticket activity

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Clean separation of UI, logic, and mock APIs for scalability
